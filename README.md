# 0FluffTally ⚡

> **High-intent event logging. No sensors. No background sync. Just counts.**

**0FluffTally** is a minimalist, privacy-first manual counter. It is built to quantify qualitative events—like meeting frequencies, task repetitions, or inventory checks—where background automation fails and human intent is required.

## 🚀 Features

- **Tactile UI:** A massive, mobile-first tally button designed for rapid, distraction-free input.
- **Contextual Logging:** Attach names and specific notes to every counting session.
- **Persistent History:** Automatically saves completed tallies to `localStorage`. Your data stays on your device.
- **Zero Bloat:** No frameworks, no external dependencies, and no tracking. Pure Vanilla JS/CSS/HTML.

The project follows a strict functional separation:
- **`index.html`**: Semantic structure and ergonomic UI layout.
- **`style.css`**: Industrial-minimalist aesthetic using CSS variables for easy theming.
- **`app.js`**: Pure functional logic handling state, DOM updates, and browser-native persistence.

- **No Analytics:** No tracking, no cookies, no third-party scripts.
